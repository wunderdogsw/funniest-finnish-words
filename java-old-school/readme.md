Description
-----------
A rather simple answer to Wunderdog's coding puzzle http://wunderdog.fi/koodaus-hassuimmat-sanat/ written in Java.

Prerequisites
-------------
You need Java 7 to run the code.

Running the code
----------------
You should have the file "alastalon_salissa.txt" in the root directory of the project. It is not included here, since the same file can be found in other answers.

The main class has a main method, so it's possible to just run the class without any parameters.
